# Message-Spam-not-spam-using-pyhton

The "Message Spam or Not" project aims to determine whether  messages enter by user are spam or not, using Python or machine learning concepts. This may involve using other methods such as manual filtering or pre-determined rules to classify messages. The goal is to effectively identify and filter out spam messages while still allowing legitimate messages to reach the intended recipient.
